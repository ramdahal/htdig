<p>Dorothy lived in
the midst of the
great Kansas
prairies, with Uncle Henry,
who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was
the farmer's wife. Their house was small,
for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon
many miles. There were four walls, a floor
and a roof, which made one room; and this
room contained a rusty looking cooking
stove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table,
three or four chairs, and the beds.</p>
