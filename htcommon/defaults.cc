  The database file used for the fuzzy \"accents\" search \
  algorithm. This database is created by \

  This attribute allows you to restrict the set of natural languages \
  that are preferred as a response to an HTTP request performed by the \
  digger. This can be done by putting one or more language tags \
  (as defined by RFC 1766) in the preferred order, separated by spaces. \
  By doing this, when the server performs a content negotiation based \
  on the 'accept-language' given by the HTTP user agent, a different \
  content can be shown depending on the value of this attribute. If \
  set to an empty list, no language will be sent and the server default \
  will be returned. \

  "boolean", "htsearch", "", "3.1.0", "Presentation:How", "add_anchors_to_excerpt: no", " \
  If set to true, the first occurrence of each matched \
  word in the excerpt will be linked to the closest \
  anchor in the document. This only has effect if the \

" }, \
{ "allow_double_slash", "false",  \
  "boolean", "htdig", "", "3.2.0b4", "Indexing:Out", "allow_double_slash: true", " \
  If set to true, strings of multiple slashes ('/') in URL paths \
  will be left intact, rather than being collapsed. This is necessary \
  for some search engine URLs which use slashes to separate fields rather \
  than to separate directory components.  However, it can lead to multiple database \
  entries refering to the same file, and it causes '/foo//../' to \
  be equivalent to '/foo/', rather than to '/'. \
" }, \
{ "allow_in_form", "",  \
  "string list", "htsearch", "", "3.1.0", "Searching:UI", "allow_in_form: search_algorithm search_results_header", " \
  Allows the specified config file attributes to be specified \
  in search forms as separate fields. This could be used to \
  allow form writers to design their own headers and footers \
  and specify them in the search form. Another example would \
  be to offer a menu of search_algorithms in the form. \
  <table> \
  <tr> \
  <td nowrap> \
  <code> \
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;SELECT NAME=\"search_algorithm\"&gt;<br> \
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;OPTION VALUE=\"exact:1 prefix:0.6 synonyms:0.5 endings:0.1\" SELECTED&gt;fuzzy<br> \
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;OPTION VALUE=\"exact:1\"&gt;exact<br> \
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/SELECT&gt; \
  </code></td> \
  </tr> \
  </table> \
  The general idea behind this is to make an input parameter out \
  of any configuration attribute that's not already automatically \
  handled by an input parameter. You can even make up your own \
  configuration attribute names, for purposes of passing data from \
  the search form to the results output. You're not restricted to \
  the existing attribute names. The attributes listed in the \
  allow_in_form list will be settable in the search form using \
  input parameters of the same name, and will be propagated to \
  the follow-up search form in the results template using template \
  variables of the same name in upper-case. \
  You can also make select lists out of any of these input \
  parameters, in the follow-up search form, using the \
  <a href=\"#build_select_lists\">build_select_lists</a> \
  configuration attribute. \
  <br>WARNING: Extreme care are should be taken with this option, as \
  allowing CGI scripts to set file names can open security holes.\
" }, \
{ "allow_numbers", "false",  \
  "boolean", "htdig htsearch", "", "all", "Indexing:What", "allow_numbers: true", " \
  If set to true, numbers are considered words. This \
  means that searches can be done on strings of digits as well as \
  regular words. All the same rules apply to numbers as \
  to words.  This does not cause numbers containing a decimal point or \
  commas to be treated as a single entity. \
  When allow_numbers is false, words are stil \
  allowed to contain digits, but they must also contain at \
  least one alphabetic character or \
  <a href=\"#extra_word_characters\">extra word</a> character. \
  To disallow digits in words, add the digits to \
  <a href=\"#valid_punctuation\">valid_punctuation</a>. \
" }, \
{ "allow_space_in_url", "false",  \
  "boolean", "htdig", "", "3.2.0b6", "Indexing:Where", "allow_space_in_url: true", " \
  If set to true, htdig will handle URLs that contain \
  embedded spaces. Technically, this is a violation of \
  RFC 2396, which says spaces should be stripped out \
  (as htdig does by default).  However, many web browsers \
  and HTML code generators violate this standard already, \
  so enabling this attribute allows htdig to handle these \
  non-compliant URLs.  Even with this attribute set, htdig \
  still strips out all white space (leading, trailing and \
  embedded), except that space characters embedded within \
  the URL will be encoded as %20. \
" }, \
{ "allow_virtual_hosts", "true",  \
  "boolean", "htdig", "", "3.0.8b2", "Indexing:Where", "allow_virtual_hosts: false", " \
  If set to true, htdig will index virtual web sites as \
  expected. If false, all URL host names will be \
  normalized into whatever the DNS server claims the IP \
  address to map to. If this option is set to false, \
  there is no way to index either \"soft\" or \"hard\" \
  virtual web sites. \

  When the first matched word in the excerpt is linked \
  to the closest anchor in the document, this string \
  can be set to specify a target in the link so the \
  resulting page is displayed in the desired frame. \
  This value will only be used if the \
  <a href=\"#add_anchors_to_excerpt\">add_anchors_to_excerpt</a> \

  If set to true, the words in the <strong>keywords</strong> \
  input parameter in the search form will be joined with logical \
  ORs rather than ANDs, so that any of the words provided will do. \
  Note that this has nothing to do with limiting the search to \
  words in META keywords tags. See the <a href=\"hts_form.html\"> \
  search form</a> documentation for details on this. \

  The credentials will be encoded using the \"Basic\" authentication \
  scheme. There <em>must</em> be a colon (:) between the username and \
  password.<br> \
  This attribute can also be specified on htdig's command line using \
  the -u option, and will be blotted out so it won't show up in a \
  process listing. If you use it directly in a configuration file, \
  be sure to protect it so it is readable only by you, and do not \
  use that same configuration file for htsearch. \
" }, \
{ "backlink_factor", "0.1",  \
  "number", "htsearch", "", "3.1.0", "Searching:Ranking", "backlink_factor: 501.1", " \
  This is a weight of \"how important\" a page is, based on \
  the number of URLs pointing to it. It's actually \
  multiplied by the ratio of the incoming URLs (backlinks) \
  and outgoing URLs (links on the page), to balance out pages \
  with lots of links to pages that link back to them. The ratio \
  gives lower weight to \"link farms\", which often have many \
  links to them.  This factor can \
  be changed without changing the database in any way. \
  However, setting this value to something other than 0 \
  incurs a slowdown on search results. \

  This attribute is used to specify a list of \
  content-type/parsers that are to be used to parse \
  documents that cannot by parsed by any of the internal \
  parsers. The list of external parsers is examined \
  before the builtin parsers are checked, so this can be \
  used to override the internal behavior without \
  recompiling htdig.<br> \
   The external parsers are specified as pairs of \
  strings. The first string of each pair is the \
  content-type that the parser can handle while the \
  second string of each pair is the path to the external \
  parsing program. If quoted, it may contain parameters, \
  separated by spaces.<br> \
   External parsing can also be done with external \
  converters, which convert one content-type to \
  another. To do this, instead of just specifying \
  a single content-type as the first string \
  of a pair, you specify two types, in the form \
  <em>type1</em><strong>-&gt;</strong><em>type2</em>, \
  as a single string with no spaces. The second \
  string will define an external converter \
  rather than an external parser, to convert \
  the first type to the second. If the second \
  type is <strong>user-defined</strong>, then \
  it's up to the converter script to put out a \
  \"Content-Type:&nbsp;<em>type</em>\" header followed \
  by a blank line, to indicate to htdig what type it \
  should expect for the output, much like what a CGI \
  script would do. The resulting content-type must \
  be one that htdig can parse, either internally, \
  or with another external parser or converter.<br> \
   Only one external parser or converter can be \
  specified for any given content-type. However, \
  an external converter for one content-type can be \
  chained to the internal parser for the same type, \
  by appending <strong>-internal</strong> to the \
  second type string (e.g. text/html->text/html-internal) \
  to perform external preprocessing on documents of \
  this type before internal parsing. \
  There are two internal parsers, for text/html and \
  text/plain.<p> \
  The parser program takes four command-line \
  parameters, not counting any parameters already \
  given in the command string:<br> \

  the document was last modified, if this information is \
  given by the server. The default is to sort by the score, \
  which ranks documents by best match. The sort methods that \
  begin with \"rev\" simply reverse the order of the \
  sort. Note that setting this to something other than \
  \"score\" will incur a slowdown in searches. \

  A list of translations pairs <em>from</em> and \
  <em>to</em>, used when accessing the database. \
  If a part of an URL matches with the \
  <em>from</em>-string of each pair, it will be \
  translated into the <em>to</em>-string just before \
  writing the URL to the database, and translated \
  back just after reading it from the database.<br> \
  This is primarily used to provide an easy way to \
  rename parts of URLs for e.g. changing \
  www.example.com/~htdig to www.htdig.org.  Two \
  different configuration files for digging and \
  searching are then used, with url_part_aliases \
  having different <em>from</em> strings, but \
  identical <em>to</em>-strings.<br> \
  See also <a \
  href=\"#common_url_parts\">common_url_parts</a>.<br> \
  Strings that are normally incorrect in URLs or \
  very seldom used, should be used as \
  <em>to</em>-strings, since extra storage will be \
  used each time one is found as normal part of a \
  URL.  Translations will be performed with priority \
  for the leftmost longest match.   Each \
  <em>to</em>-string must be unique and not be a \
  part of any other <em>to</em>-string.  It also helps \
  to keep the <em>to</em>-strings short to save space \
  in the database. Other than that, the choice of \
  <em>to</em>-strings is pretty arbitrary, as they \
  just provide a temporary, internal encoding in the \
  databases, and none of the characters in these \
  strings have any special meaning.<br> \
  Note that when this attribute is changed, the \
  database should be rebuilt, unless the effect of \
  \"moving\" the affected URLs in the database is \
  wanted, as described above.<br> \
  <strong>Please note:</strong> Don't just copy the \
  example below into a single configuration file. \
  There are two separate settings of \
  <em>url_part_aliases</em> below; the first one is \
  for the configuration file to be used by htdig, \
  htmerge, and htnotify, and the second one is for the \
  configuration file to be used by htsearch. \
  In this example, htdig will encode the URL \
  \"http://search.example.com/~htdig/contrib/stuff.html\" \
  as \"*sitecontrib/stuff*2\" in the databases, and \
  htsearch will decode it as \
  \"http://www.htdig.org/contrib/stuff.htm\".<br> \
  As of version 3.1.6, you can also do more complex \
  rewriting of URLs using \
  <a href=\"#url_rewrite_rules\">url_rewrite_rules</a> and \
  <a href=\"#search_rewrite_rules\">search_rewrite_rules</a>. \

  This is a list of pairs, <em>regex</em> <em>replacement</em> used to \
  permanently rewrite URLs as they are indexed. The left hand string is \
  a regular expression; the right hand string is  a literal string with \
  embedded placeholders for fragments that matched  inside brackets in \
  the regex. \\0 is the whole matched string, \\1 to \\9 are  bracketted \
  substrings. Note that the <strong>entire</strong> URL is replaced by \
  the right hand string (not just the portion which matches the left hand\
  string).  Thus, a leading and trailing (.*) should be included in the \
  pattern, with matching placeholders in the replacement string.<br> \
  Rewrite rules are applied sequentially to each  \
  incoming URL before normalization occurs. Rewriting does not stop \
  once a match has been made, so multiple rules may affect a given URL. \
  See also <a href=\"#url_part_aliases\">url_part_aliases</a> which \
  allows URLs to be of one  \
form during indexing and translated for results. \

  <em>constant</em>, by which the hit score is \

  for negative numbers.  Either part is optional, \
  but must come in this order.<br> \
