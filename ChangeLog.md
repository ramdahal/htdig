# ChangeLog

Looking for the ChangeLog by the original development team?
http://www.htdig.org/

### Sat Nob 18 2017

Documented how to use [lighttpd](http://www.lighttpd.net/)
for [testing](https://github.com/andy5995/htdig/blob/master/TESTING.md)

### Tue Nov 14 2017

Removed former ChangeLog; it would be confusing for newcomers

### Mon Nov 13 2017

Removed htdoc directory. New web site is needed.

Removed former README; it would be confusing for newcomers (a link to
the web site of the original maintainers will remain at the top of this
document)

Merged a commit (patch apparently from Jim Cole) lost when I reverted to 3.2.0b6

>I see it's been some years since this has been worked on. Would you accept
any PRs if they came your way, or would it be best if I made a separate fork
if I decided to promote and continue this project? @roklein

>Thank you for your interest in this project. I think it's better you fork
and continue there. My repository is basically up to version 3.2b6 and some
patches from further down the tree and those used by some major distributions
(suse, fedora,...). So in a way, this is probably the most stable version of
htdig, currently. Unfortunately it seems, I only put the one tree into the
repository (I converted it from CVS), so the older 3.1.6 stuff isn't here.
Also the early 4.0 code is missing, but I think you are way better off, not
using it. Plese note, there is a fork from jrsupplee which has three additional
patches. I didn't review those, however, and never got a pull request.

>Best regards,
Robert
